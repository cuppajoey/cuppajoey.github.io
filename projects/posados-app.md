I designed and developed a React Native app with an integrated CMS dashboard that significantly improved customer experience across their 13 East Texas locations.

- Built on React Native to support both iOS and Android users from a single code base.
- Integrated with a REST API for management of daily specials and resturant locations.
- Focused on an improved ordering experience to increase online sales and customer retention.
