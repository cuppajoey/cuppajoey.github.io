SecretOwl is an app I created to experiment with Microsoft Outlookâ€™s extension API. The extension allows users to create links to view secret information (i.e., passwords) which would be destroyed after the recipient viewed it. Users could increase the security by setting an expiration date or a password required to view the secret message.
