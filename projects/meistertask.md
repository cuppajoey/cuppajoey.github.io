An unofficial PHP client library for the MeisterTask API.

[MeisterTask](http://meistertask.com) is an online project management tool with a Kanban board UI, similar to Trello, Asana, or Jira.

When I started this project, I worked on a team that used MeisterTask for project management. Our team also had a couple side projects with their own websites and HTML forms to contact us. The traffic from these forms was irregular and the notifications were occasionally overlooked. To improve awareness and response to these notifications, I developed this library to automatically create a new task for each form submission.
