I designed and developed a custom website for Thomas Oilfield Services. The design utilizes visual story telling with a focus on bold colors &amp; photography that represents the company’s as a standout in the industry.

At the start of the project, our team was hired to shoot high-quality photos of Thomas’ crew and equipment on-site in East and West Texas. Our goal was to highlight the cleanliness of their equipment, the uniformity of their crew and their overall commitment to excellence.
