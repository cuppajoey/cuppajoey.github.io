title: Creating an employee benefits app for a private insurance firm
type: project
---

I designed and developed an app for EBC&mdash;a private insurance consulting agency&mdash;which enabled their clients to manage their employee health benefits during open enrollment and securely access their records year-round.

- Built on a headless CMS for user management and an extendable database API.
- Wrote custom database tables in MySQL to flexibly store company and employee data at scale.
- Wrote progressively-enhanced Javascript for multi-step applications that scale beautifully on mobile devices.
- Integrated with mPDF library to automatically generate PDF copies of employee applications for HR records.
